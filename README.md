# FICO Score Classification Project

## Overview

This project aims to classify FICO credit scores using various machine learning models to categorize individuals into different risk categories based on their creditworthiness.

## Key Features

* Data Exploration: Initial analysis of the dataset to understand the distribution of FICO scores and ensure the data is complete.
* Model Building: Development and evaluation of machine learning models for credit score classification. 

## Models Explored

* KMeans Clustering: This model is utilized for segmenting individuals into categories based on their FICO scores. The approach includes an analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters to effectively categorize the scores.
* MSE Minimization: A technique applied to optimize model parameters and improve predictions by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted and actual FICO scores.
